### A little story on how I got my SSCP - Systems Security Certified Practitioner. 

Throughout my college years I've faced multiple challenges: There was a professor strike in first year that resulted in some challenging self-learning, cancellation of the shuttle bus service that would lead to me getting my first car ($400/m insurance for a 20yo hurt), and, of course, the pandemic, which made a lot of people take a year off and focus on certifications or pursuing jobs. I decided to commit to my studies and finish my degree. But I had a goal, I wanted to receive an industry-recognized certification in CyberSecurity before graduation.

## The why 

There are multiple reasons why I wanted a certification. I thought it would make me stand out from my similarly-educated peers, as well as challenge my knowledge, and of course it would make me learn something new. I did some research on which one to get. Security+ seemed too entry level, so I opted in for SSCP.

## The how

I started reading the SSCP book only to think "I already know all this". I started studying in my 3d year, so I've already had a lot of background in information security, and the book was mostly review for me. I have gotten through a few chapters and started taking the online practice exams, which were challenging, but by a right amount. After a few months of review one of my coworkers said he just passed his exam. I instantly booked mine. A week later I was SSCP certified. 

It felt unbelievable, since the questions in the actual exam were much, much harder than the practice questions. Also, I was taking the exam during a storm so the lights went out mid exam, which unnecessarily added to the already present exam anxiety. 

When I saw I passed I tried to keep my composure, but once I was alone in the hallway I could not stop myself from pretty much "jumping around". It was an overall great experience, so if you want to challenge yourself you should start choosing a certification to study for right about now.

## The what's next

I have already bought my CCSP books, so that's where I am headed next. It goes more in depth on cloud, which is not only the future but also the present. It requires more experience than I currently have, but it comes with time.
